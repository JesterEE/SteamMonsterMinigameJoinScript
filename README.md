# Update
I pushed a commented out script since the script is not currently working correctly.  When the script is active you will get the default landing page until I fix the issue.  Maybe today, maybe not ... SORRY!  If someone has time to investigate/fix it, please do and offer a pull request.  See my notes in the issue tracker [here](https://github.com/JesterEE/SteamMonsterMinigameJoinScript/issues/1).

Until it's fixed, I recommend using this command from the Console:

<code>
'(function(key){setInterval(function(){JoinGame(key);$J('.newmodal').remove();}, 2000)})(ROOM_KEY_HERE)'
</code>

#Steam Summer 2015 Monster Minigame Join Script#

[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/fuck-it-ship-it.svg)](http://forthebadge.com) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JesterEE/SteamMonsterMinigameJoinScript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JesterEE/SteamMonsterMinigameJoinScript)

## Purpose ##

A Greasemonkey/Tapermonkey script to modify the games landing launch page to add the ability of launching a specific Game ID.

## Important ##

This script is simple, but does a bit of code injection because I don't know a better way to do it (I don't really know Javascript or GM/TM work-arounds).  You have my word I am not doing anything malicious here but this script does grant _unsafeWindow_ privaleges.  Please look over the code for yourself.  __You have been warned!__

## Installation ##
